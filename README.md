# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective

This task focuses on setting up the Expo Go environment for mobile app development using React Native. Expo simplifies the mobile development workflow and allows real-time testing directly on physical devices, eliminating the need for emulators.

---

## Tools & Requirements

To complete this setup, the following tools are required:

- ✅ Node.js LTS (Installed via https://nodejs.org)
- ✅ Visual Studio Code (Recommended IDE)
- ✅ Operating System: Windows/macOS/Linux
- ✅ Expo Go App (Installed on a physical Android or iOS device)

---

## Why Use Expo Go?

Traditional mobile development often depends on simulators or emulators which require high system resources. Expo Go offers an efficient, lightweight alternative by allowing:

- Real-time preview on physical devices
- Seamless cross-platform support (Android & iOS)
- No need for Xcode or Android Studio for basic testing

## Setup Steps

### ✅ 1. System Check

- **OS:** Windows 10
- **VS Code:** Installed
- **Node.js:** Installed (LTS version)

### ✅ 2. Installed Expo Go

- **Website Visited:** [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
- **Device Used:** Android - Samsung Galaxy A14
- **Store:** Google Play Store
- **App Installed:** Expo Go (latest version)

### ✅ 3. Account Setup

## Challenges Faced

- No major issues encountered
- Installation and login were smooth
- Reminder: Ensure a stable internet connection when scanning QR codes or loading apps in Expo Go

---

## Next Steps

- Install Expo CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
